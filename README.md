## Brain-Inspired AI and Neuroinformatics Lab

Welcome to BrAINLabs Inc. We are a research laboratory dedicated to exploring the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Neuroscience. Our mission is to develop innovative AI solutions that address the complex challenges of the 21st century. At the core of our research, we draw inspiration from nature to create AI systems that are both explainable and efficient.

## Mission Statement

At BrAINLabs, we strive to explore the intricate relationship between artificial intelligence and the neuroscience of the human brain. By harnessing the latest advancements in technology and research, we aim to:

*   Develop intelligent systems that are interpretable and efficient.
*   Enhance the understanding of neural mechanisms through computational modeling.
*   Provide specialized industry services and consultation.

## Research Areas

Our research is primarily focused on two key domains:

### Large Language Models (LLM)

We are developing advanced deep learning models that simulate brain activity to aid researchers in understanding neural dynamics.

*   **Optimized Compression for Transformers**: Designing efficient techniques to reduce the size and computational requirements of transformer-based models while maintaining accuracy. This work focuses on model pruning, quantization, and compression methods to enhance scalability on resource-constrained systems.
*   **Security and Privacy of LLM**: Investigating vulnerabilities in large language models and developing robust solutions to mitigate risks, including adversarial attacks, data leakage, and model misuse.
*   **Applications of LLM for Cybersecurity**: Utilizing the advanced reasoning and pattern recognition capabilities of LLMs to detect and mitigate cyber threats, including automated threat intelligence and secure coding recommendations.

### Neuromorphic Computing

We utilize machine learning techniques to analyze neuroimaging data for the early detection and understanding of neurological disorders.

*   **Learning Algorithms for Spiking Neural Networks (SNN)**: Developing algorithms tailored to SNNs which emulate biological neuron spiking. These focus on event-driven learning paradigms for real-time processing with low energy consumption.
*   **Applications of SNN**: Exploring the use of SNNs in robotics, prosthetics, and neuromorphic hardware to enable adaptive, low-power solutions for real-world problems.

## Team

Our lab consists of a multidisciplinary team of researchers and graduate students from the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) and other prestigious institutions. We are committed to pushing the boundaries of AI and neuroscience research.
